# JAMPI: a C++ parallel programming model

#### Whats is here?
This repository contains JAMPI, a C++ API that allows implementing parallel programs
with a custom and generic scheduling mechanism that can be implemented by the user 
to be applied at runtime.

It is divided in two sub-directories: 

- **jampi**:
contains JAMPI source code.

- **benchmarks**:
contains some parallel applications implemented applying JAMPI.
